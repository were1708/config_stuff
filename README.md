we may need to do some things in order to get everything working


1. generate languages for en-UTF8

`sudo locale-gen "en_US.UTF-8"`

`sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales`

2. install ripgrep for telescope and `make` for Lazy.nvim packages

`sudo apt install make ripgrep`

3. install fzf for `edit` and `history`

`sudo apt install fzf`
